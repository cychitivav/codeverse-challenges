"""
Given two strings, a and b , that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make a and b anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.

INPUT:
Test cases,t.
Two strings a and b, for each test case.

OUTPUT:
Desired O/p

CONSTRAINTS:
string lengths â‰¤ 10000

Note:
Anagram of a word is formed by rearranging the letters of the word.
For e.g. -> For the word RAM - MAR,ARM,AMR,RMA etc. are few anagrams.
